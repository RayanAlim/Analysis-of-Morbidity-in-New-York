# Data {#sec-data}

DATA This analysis utilizes data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, specifically provided by the Bureau of Vital Statistics {@NYCData}.
The dataset encompasses records of deaths in New York City since 2007, detailing the leading causes of death categorized by sex and ethnicity.
Each entry in this dataset is derived from NYC death certificates which are the official documentation of every death occurring within the city's jurisdiction.

Dataset Context and Broader Implications The investigation into the leading causes of death within New York City holds significant public health importance.
It allows for a nuanced understanding of mortality trends, guiding health policy, and intervention strategies tailored to specific demographics and causes.
By examining mortality across different sexes and ethnic groups, this analysis contributes to identifying health disparities and targeting efforts to address them.

Variables and Data Examination The dataset comprises several key variables, including: Year: The year of the recorded death.
Leading Cause: The primary cause of death as categorized by ICD-10 codes.
Sex: The sex of the deceased (Male, Female, or Gender Non-Conforming).
Race Ethnicity: The self-reported ethnicity of the deceased, including categories such as Hispanic, White Non-Hispanic, Black Non-Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander, and Others.
Deaths: The total number of deaths attributed to the leading cause.
Death Rate and Age-Adjusted Death Rate: Rates per 100,000 population, providing standardized comparisons across different population sizes and age structures.

Alternative Datasets and Justification While other mortality databases exist, such as the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, the chosen dataset offers a detailed and localized perspective specific to New York City.
This specificity provides a more precise tool for understanding and addressing urban health dynamics, making it more relevant for city-specific policy-making and health intervention strategies.

Data Cleaning and Variable Construction Preliminary data cleaning focused on addressing missing values, ensuring consistency in categorical variables, and suppressing unreliable rates as mentioned.
New variables, such as aggregated categories for cause of death or demographic groupings, were constructed to facilitate analysis.
For instance, causes of death were grouped into broader categories (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, cancers) to examine trends at a macro level.

Summary Statistics and Relationships Initial exploratory data analysis revealed key trends and disparities in mortality rates across different populations within New York City.
We provide summary statistics, including mean death rates and distributions of deaths by cause ethnicity, to provide insights into the health landscape of the city.
For example, preliminary findings indicate significant differences in heart disease mortality between ethnic groups, warranting further investigation.

Measurement and Methodological Notes The measurement of mortality and its causes relies on the accurate classification of death certificates, adhering to ICD-10 standards.
This classification ensures comparability with other datasets and robustness in identifying health trends.
However, it's important to acknowledge potential limitations in cause-of-death reporting and classification, which may impact the analysis.
To ensure privacy and reliability, rates based on small numbers (Relative Standard Error, RSE, \> 30) and aggregate counts less than 5 have been suppressed.
This suppression safeguards against the identification of individuals in rare categories and ensures statistical reliability.

## Composition

-   What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)?
    Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)?
    Please provide a description.

    -   Each row in the dataset represents an aggregate count of deaths for a specific leading cause, categorized by year, sex, and race/ethnicity.

-   How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?

    -   Over 1000 instances.

-   Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
    If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set?
    Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)?
    If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified.
    If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).

    -   This dataset contains all recorded instances of death in New York City between 2007 - 2014.

-   What data does each instance consist of?
    “Raw” data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features?
    In either case, please provide a description.
    Each instance consists of counts of death including demographic data (race and sex) and year.
    Is there a label or target associated with each instance?
    If so, please provide a description.

    -   No.

-   Is any information missing from individual instances?
    If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable).
    This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.

    -   Some instances may have missing data where the information was not recorded or reported.

-   Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users’ movie ratings, social network links)?
    If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.

    -   Yes through demographic categorization (race and sex) and alignment.

-   Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)?
    If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.

    -   No.

-   Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?
    If so, please provide a description.

    -   Concerns arise given the potential for inaccuracies in the reporting and classification of death causes.

-   Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)?
    If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer?
    Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.

    -   Self-contained.

-   Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
    If so, please provide a description.

    -   Generated from public sources.

-   Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?
    If so, please describe why.

    -   No.

-   Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)?
    If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.

    -   Yes, sex is identified.

-   Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset?
    If so, please describe how.

    -   No.

-   Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)?
    If so, please provide a description.

    -   This data does contain race origins and causes of death.

-   Any other comments?

    -   No.
